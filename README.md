# linux-surface for Arch Linux latest stable kernel

- Currently based on Arch Linux linux kernel 4.20.x

- Intended for **Surface Book 1 (especially, with Performance Base)** and **Surface 3**, but all patches (or equivalent) from [jakeday repository](https://github.com/jakeday/linux-surface) are applied

- PKGBUILD is from [core/linux](https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/?h=packages/linux)
	- `linux.preset` is modified not to create fallback initramfs. If you need it, rename `linux.preset.orig` to `linux.preset`
